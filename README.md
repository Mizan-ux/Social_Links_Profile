### Built with

### What I learned

- I learned how to structure a clean and responsive layout using a mobile-first approach.

- I understood the difference between width, min-width, and max-width, and how to use them to keep the layout flexible across screen sizes.

- I replaced fixed px values with responsive units like %, rem, and max-width to make the design more adaptable.

- I learned how to make the entire card (not just text) clickable using semantic HTML by wrapping the entire block in an anchor <a> tag.

- I maintained the original design while adding interactivity through hover and focus states for better user experience and accessibility.

- I practiced using Flexbox and Grid together effectively to create modern, clean layouts.

  
### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web] - This helped me to understand concepts more clearly.
